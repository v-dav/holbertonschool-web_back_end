## üßê Project Overview

Welcome to the "Caching" project! In this project, we dive into the world of caching algorithms, exploring different strategies for cache replacement.

Understanding caching algorithms is crucial in optimizing system performance. Caching involves storing copies of frequently accessed data in a location that allows for faster retrieval. Different caching systems employ various strategies for deciding which data to keep and which to replace.

## üìñ Learning objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts to anyone:

- What a caching system is
- What FIFO (First In, First Out) means
- What LIFO (Last In, First Out) means
- What LRU (Least Recently Used) means
- What MRU (Most Recently Used) means
- What LFU (Least Frequently Used) means
- The purpose of a caching system
- The limitations of a caching system

### üéì Ressources

To grasp the concepts of caching algorithms, it's recommended to read or watch resources related to cache replacement policies [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#First_In_First_Out_%28FIFO%29)
