## Project Overview

Welcome to the ECMAScript 6 (ES6) Concepts project! In this project, you will dive into the world of ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, and explore its new features and concepts. ES6 introduced significant changes and improvements to JavaScript, and this project will help you understand them. You will learn about block-scoped variables, arrow functions, default parameters, rest and spread function parameters, string templating, object creation, iterators, and for-of loops.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts without the need for external references:

- What ES6 is
- New features introduced in ES6
- The difference between a constant and a variable
- Block-scoped variables
- Arrow functions and function parameters defaulting to them
- Rest and spread function parameters
- String templating in ES6
- Object creation and their properties in ES6
- Iterators and for-of loops
