## üßê Project Overview

Welcome to the "Pagination" project! In this project, you'll explore advanced techniques for handling and presenting large datasets and gain insights into managing data efficiently, enhancing user experience, and ensuring resilience in the face of dataset modifications.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Description

The "Pagination" project focuses on implementing effective pagination strategies for datasets. Here is three key learning objectives:

1. **Simple Pagination:**
   - Implement pagination using basic parameters such as `page` and `page_size`.
   - Gain the ability to navigate and display specific portions of a dataset seamlessly.

2. **Hypermedia Metadata:**
   - Explore the concept of paginating datasets with hypermedia metadata.
   - Learn how to enhance user navigation and discoverability through additional metadata.

3. **Deletion-Resilient Pagination:**
   - Implement pagination in a deletion-resilient manner.
   - Develop strategies to handle dataset modifications without compromising the integrity of pagination.

## üìñ Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

- How to paginate a dataset using simple parameters like `page` and `page_size`.
- How to implement pagination with hypermedia metadata for improved user interaction.
- How to create deletion-resilient pagination, ensuring consistency amid dataset modifications.
