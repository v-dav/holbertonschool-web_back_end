## üßê Project Overview

Welcome to the "Python - Async comprehensions" project! In this project, we will discover the  asynchronous comprehensions in Python. Asynchronous comprehensions provide a concise and expressive way to work with asynchronous generators. 

## üìñ Resources

- [PEP 530 ‚Äì Asynchronous Comprehensions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0530/)
- [What‚Äôs New in Python: Asynchronous Comprehensions / Generators](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2017/02/14/whats-new-in-python-asynchronous-comprehensions-generators/)
- [Type-hints for generators](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42531143/how-to-type-hint-a-generator-in-python-3)

## üéì Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- How to write an asynchronous generator
- How to use async comprehensions
- How to type-annotate generators
