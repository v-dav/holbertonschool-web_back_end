## üßê Project Description:

The MySQL Advanced project covers advanced topics of MySQL database management system. It focuses on enhancing your skills in database design, optimization, and advanced SQL queries. Below are the key topics covered in this project:

- **Tables with Constraints**: Learn how to create tables with various constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints.
- **Query Optimization**: Understand how to optimize queries by adding indexes to tables. Explore different types of indexes and their impact on query performance.
- **Stored Procedures**: Learn about stored procedures and how to create them in MySQL. Understand their benefits and how to use them for efficient data processing.
- **Triggers**: Explore triggers in MySQL and learn how to implement them to automatically perform actions based on specified events in the database.
- **Views**: Understand views and how to create them in MySQL. Learn how views can simplify complex queries and provide a virtual representation of data.
- **Functions and Operators**: Explore built-in functions and operators in MySQL and learn how to use them in SQL queries.

## üìñ Learning Objectives:

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to:

- Explain how to create tables with constraints in MySQL.
- Optimize queries by adding indexes to tables.
- Implement stored procedures and functions in MySQL for efficient data processing.
- Create views to simplify complex queries and provide a virtual representation of data.
- Implement triggers to automate actions based on specified events in the database.
