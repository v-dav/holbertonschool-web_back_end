## 🧐 Project Overview:

This project explores the concept of internationalization (i18n), empowering you to make your web application accessible to a global audience by tailoring it to different languages and locales. Through hands-on experience, you'll gain the expertise to:

* **Craft localized interfaces:** Present user interfaces, including labels, buttons, and messages, in the user's preferred language.
* **Format dates and times:** Ensure dates and times are displayed according to the user's locale, respecting cultural conventions.
* **Deliver a seamless user experience:** Cater to diverse users with a globally accessible application.

**Important Notions:**

* **Locale:** A combination of language and region identifiers, representing cultural and geographical variations (e.g., "en-US", "es-MX").
* **Localization:** The process of adapting an application to a specific locale, encompassing translation, date/time formatting, measurement conversion, and currency formatting.
* **Pluralization:** Rendering text appropriately based on the number (singular, plural, or other variations) of items being referred to, as dictated by the target language's grammar rules.

## ⚙️ Learning Objectives:

* **Parametrize Flask templates:** Display dynamic content based on the selected language.
* **Infer correct locale:** Determine the user's preferred language using various methods (URL parameters, user settings, request headers).
* **⏰ Localize timestamps:** Adapt timestamps to the user's locale for accurate representation.
