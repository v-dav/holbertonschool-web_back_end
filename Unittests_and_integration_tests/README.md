## üßê Project Overview
The "Unittests and Integration Tests" project is focused on the essential practices of software testing, emphasizing unit tests and integration tests. Understanding the importance of writing tests to ensure the reliability, functionality and maintainability of your code is a fundamental skill for any developer.

## üìñ Learning objectives
 - Grasp the importance of unit tests in verifying the functionality of individual functions.
 - Understand the role of integration tests in testing end-to-end code paths.
 - Explore Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and practices.
 - The difference between unit and integration tests.
 - Common testing patterns such as mocking, parametrizations and fixtures

## üéì About some Test-Driven Develoment concepts

Effective software testing is crucial for reducing defects, enhancing maintainability, and ensuring the overall reliability of a codebase. By implementing unit tests, developers can verify the functionality of individual components, uncovering and addressing defects early in the development process. Automated tests play a pivotal role in this scenario, offering advantages over manual testing in terms of speed, repeatability, and coverage. The principle of having the smallest components possible, each performing a simple task exceptionally well, aligns with the concept of unit testing. This approach allows for targeted testing and easier identification of issues. In a broader context, the continuous integration process complements these testing practices by automating the integration of code changes into a shared repository, ensuring that tests are executed regularly, and the entire codebase remains cohesive and functional. Together, these concepts form a robust testing strategy that contributes to building reliable and maintainable software.

### Unit testing - "Granular level"

- **Purpose:** To test individual units or components of a program in isolation. Process of testing that a particular function returns expected results for different set of inputs. Only logic inside the tested function.
- **Goal** is to answer the question: if everything defined outside this function works as expected, does this function work as expected ?
- **Scope:** Focuses on a small, isolated piece of code (e.g., a function or a method). Tests standard inputs and edge cases.
- **Dependencies:** Dependencies are typically mocked or replaced with test doubles to isolate the unit being tested.

### Integration tests - Higher level

Aim to test code path end-to-end. In general, only low level functions that make external calls such as HTTP requests, file I/O, db I/O are mocked.

- **Purpose:** To test how different units or components work together as a whole.
- **Scope:** Involves testing interactions between multiple components or modules.
- **Dependencies:** Real dependencies are used, and the tests may involve databases, external services, etc.

### Difference


- **Unit tests** focus on verifying that individual units of code (e.g., functions, methods) work as expected in isolation. Dependencies are often replaced with test doubles.
- **Integration tests** focus on verifying that different units or components work together correctly. They involve real dependencies and test the interactions between components.

**Example Scenario:**

- **Unit Test Scenario:** Testing a function that calculates the square of a number. You mock any external functions it calls and only focus on its logic.
- **Integration Test Scenario:** Testing a complete user registration flow, including database interactions, validation, and email notifications. You use the actual database and external services to ensure the entire process works.

In summary, unit tests are more focused and isolate individual units, while integration tests ensure that different units work harmoniously in a real-world scenario. Both types are essential for comprehensive testing, and a good testing strategy often involves a combination of both.
